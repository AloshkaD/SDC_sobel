You'll pass in img and set the parameter orient as 'x' or 'y' to take
either the x or y gradient. You'll set min_thresh, and max_thresh to specify the range to select for binary output.

The output is an array of the same size as the input image of ones where gradients were in the threshold range,
 and zeros everywhere else.
